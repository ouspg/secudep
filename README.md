# Secure Deployment for Challenging Environments

BSc. Thesis hopefully progressing with peer pressure from [OUSPG Open](https://github.com/ouspg/ouspg-open).

**Research question/problem (Msc.):** How to securely deploy/provision Linux installations over insecure network/Internet using truested starting point?

**Research question/problem (BSc.):** Smaller subset of the above :)

# things

 * Layers to consider:
   * Hardware, boot, OS, configuration management, application
   * e.g. Physical server + USB media, iPXE, Alpine, cloud-init, Docker
   * e.g. Virtualization + PXE, iPXE, Some OS, ... (See #2)
   * UEFI Secure Boot out of scope?
   * Trusted Computing out of scope?
   * How high to climb in this thesis?

 * Chain of trust:
   * We have to trust something. then pass the trust forward.
     * -> boot image which GPG signed which is verified and then written into USB media (See #3)
     * -> trusted USB media includes X.509 certificate pinned HTTPS URL
     * -> Next step (HTTPS) could use HTTP Basic Auth or X.509 client cert for authentication
     * -> HTTPS delivers e.g. GPG public keys for Alpine/CentOS/Debian repository validation
     * -> drop root SSH authorized_keys into installed OS
   * Lots of steps can be public on Internet
     * How to deal with things which can't?
     * Preshared password? X.509 client cert auth?
   * What are "impossible" (beyond reasonable effort) or hard to trust?
     * Hardware backdoors/vulnerabilities, OS distribution backdoors/vulns

 * What existing software and features there already is?
   * Network booting: iPXE?
   * Certificate pinning: is iPXE's pinning sufficient?
   * Repository and package signing: GPG signatures? OpenBSD Signify?
   * Configuration management: cloud-init? Ansible? Salt? Puppet?
   * Applications: Docker?

 * Implementation
   * Easy to copy and adjust ("Personal Boot Infrastructure")
     * git clone, $EDITOR config, scripts/build, git push https://example.com/own/repo
     * Trust of the build environment
       * Building certificate pinnings with TLS MITM not worth it
       * Signing keys, etc. need to be protected
   * Easy to build
     * Dockerize builds?
     * Generate as much as possible from simple configuration
   * Future work (easily out of scope for this thesis):
     * Maybe everything into one USB stick to work without Internet
     * Boot verifies signed commits from Git repo

 * Describe experiments
   * Attack the implementation
   * MITM
   * Broken keys

 * Describe attack vectors
   * For every layer (hardware, boot, HTTPS, X.509/TLS, OS install, etc)
   * What we can fight against and what we can't do
