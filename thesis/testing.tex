% Testing Chapter

Three case studies were performed. The case studies build an arch from
studying how a current state-of-the-art installation system works
towards testing the promise of secudep to making a more secure
installation system.

The first case study looks into an already existing installation
system to verify what protocols are used in the process. This is done
to verify what is written in the introduction chapter about the
current state of the art.

Next case study compares results from the first case study with the
implementation details of secudep. The purpose is to compare how
an already existing installation system differs from secudep.

Third and last case study looks into secudep's promise to make a more
secure installation system. This is done by simulating the attack
scenarios, for example man-in-the-middle attack, and observing how
secudep behaves.


\section{Case Study 1: Identify Protocols}
\label{sec:casestudy1}

\subsection{What was studied}

The purpose of this case study is to identify network protocols used
in an online installation system system. This study also verifies the
involved protocols which were described in the introduction chapter.

A service called boot.foo.sh~\cite{boot-foo-sh} is used as an
installation system. Boot.foo.sh was chosen because it is an open
service known to be used for automatic installations in enterprises
and it has been an inspiration to this thesis to make installation
system safer to use.

Boot.foo.sh is used to install the CentOS~7 Linux operating
system. CentOS Linux is a community driven effort to provide a free
alternative to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). CentOS is built using
RHEL source code. Red Hat has 67 \% market share of the market for
Linux distributions according to Gartner's
analysis~\cite{gartner-redhat}.

\subsection{How it was done}

The installation was done using a virtual machine. VirtualBox was
chosen as virtualization software because it is free, open source and
has an easy to use network traffic recording functionality.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{Network traffic recording setup.\label{fig:network-recording}}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{network-recording.pdf}
\end{figure}

With VirtualBox's network traffic recording it is possible to get
network traffic captured for the whole lifetime of a virtual
machine. The capture is saved as a standard PCAP file which can later
be opened in a network protocol analyzer for
investigation. Figure~\ref{fig:network-recording} has the typical
traffic capturing setup with a computer using the installation system,
another computer recording the traffic, a network switch to arrange
traffic flows and the Internet containing the installation system in
use.

The traffic capture was then analyzed using Wireshark network protocol
analyzer. Wireshark is a free and open source network protocol
analyzer which has the capability to help an expert user analyze many
different network protocols and their internals.

Traffic analysis was done by hand, looking at the captured traffic
recording and identifying the protocols used.

\subsection{Results found}

Traffic recording was 788 megabytes of network traffic containing over
883000 network packets. The Recording contains spans just over nine
minutes. This time span contains all of the network traffic from the
startup of the virtual machine to the end of operating system
installation.

      Installation files & HTTP (DS)   \\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

Summary of the protocols used during various steps of the installation
process can be found from Table~\ref{tab:found_protocols_table}.

Installation steps are identified and named for each installation
system used. The steps are discussed in chronological order of
appearance as found from traffic recording.

\subsection{Analysis of results}

``Address resolution'' is the first step and its purpose is to get the
IP address and DNS server addresses for the system to be
installed. DHCP is the standard protocol for this, and it was found to
be used also in this case.

``Name resolution'' is used to translate host names into IP addresses
to communicate with other servers. DNS protocol is used for name
resolution needs.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{boot.foo.sh boot menu showing selection of operating
    systems.\label{fig:bootmenu}}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{bootfoosh-bootmenu.png}
\end{figure}

``Boot menu'' is used to display the operating systems available for
installation. Boot menu from boot.foo.sh can be seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:bootmenu}. Boot.foo.sh uses HTTP protocol to fetch
various files needed to display the boot menu.

``Kernel and initrd'' are the files needed to launch Linux
installation. These two files are downloaded over the Internet, the
kernel is executed and it continues the boot process. HTTP was used to
communicate with a CentOS 7 mirror to fetch the needed files.

``Kickstart'' is a CentOS specific file for automating unattended
installation. It is a set of instructions downloaded and executed by
the installation process. The kickstart file is downloaded by software
inside the initrd system, so at this point the control of installation
is already switched over to the CentOS operating system's own
installer. HTTP was used to communicate with boot.foo.sh server to
fetch the kickstart file.

``Installation files'' are the contents of the operating system to be
installed. The files are downloaded and extracted to the local hard
drive for installation. The operating system installer is usually
trusted to verify the digital signatures of the downloaded content
before extracting the files into the hard drive. For example CentOS
uses OpenPGP~\cite{RFC4880} (``GPG'') signatures. The CentOS
documentation~\cite{centos-gpg} states that

\begin{quote}
``Each stable RPM package that is published by CentOS Project is signed
with a GPG signature. By default, yum and the graphical update tools
will verify these signatures and refuse to install any packages that
are not signed, or have an incorrect signature. You should always
verify the signature of a package prior to installation. These
signatures ensure that the packages you install are what was produced
by the CentOS Project and have not been altered by any mirror or
web site providing the packages.''
\end{quote}

However, before installation files with related GPG digital signatures
can be verified an attacker could have replaced the kernel or initrd
from previous step with a compromised version and thus the finished
installation could become compromised. Previous steps must be
protected before the operating system's own installation files in
order to enable the installer's own protections.


\section{Case Study 2: Comparing boot.foo.sh and secudep}
\label{sec:casestudy2}

\subsection{What was studied}

This case study compares implementation details of secudep to an
already existing installation system solution which was studied in
case study 1. The purpose of this is to see the differences between
the network protocols used by these two systems.

\subsection{How it was done}

The results from case study 1 was used as a base, and then
implementation details about secudep were compared against the base.

\subsection{Results found}

\begin{table}[!ht]
  % Add some padding to the table cells:
  \def\arraystretch{1.1}%
  \begin{center}
    \caption{Comparison between how boot.foo.sh and secudep use
      protocols. DS in table means Digital
      Signatures.\label{tab:comparison_table}}
    \begin{tabular}{| l | l | l |}
      \hline
      Step               & boot.foo.sh   & secudep    \\
      \hline
      Address resolution & DHCP          & DHCP       \\
      Name resolution    & DNS           & DNS        \\
      Boot menu          & HTTP          & HTTPS (DS) \\
      Digital signatures & N/A           & HTTPS      \\
      Kernel and initrd  & HTTP          & HTTP (DS)  \\
      Kickstart          & HTTP          & HTTPS      \\
      Installation files & HTTP (DS)     & HTTP (DS)  \\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

Results of comparing boot.foo.sh and secudep can be found from
Table~\ref{tab:comparison_table}. Boot.foo.sh results are same as in
case study 1. The differences between boot.foo.sh and secudep are
discussed next.


\subsection{Analysis of results}

Address and name resolution steps are identical in both systems. As
discussed in the introduction chapter, these protocols are standards
and therefore difficult to change.

''Boot menu'' is used to display the operating systems available for
installation. HTTP used by boot.foo.sh is susceptible to
man-in-the-middle attack. Secudep uses HTTPS (HTTP over TLS) with
signed files to remediate this issue.

Secudep uses digital signatures that are fetched over HTTPS.\@ This is
a step missing from boot.foo.sh.

Kernel and initrd are the files needed to launch the Linux
installation. Both boot.foo.sh and secudep systems use the HTTP
protocol. Again HTTP is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. HTTP
is used because the files are fetched from CentOS's official mirror
over the Internet. Secudep uses digital signatures to verify
downloaded content. After kernel and initrd are downloaded and digital
signatures are verified, the execution is handed over to the
kernel. This means that secudep cannot provide digital signatures for
any following files.


\section{Case Study 3: Testing attacks against secudep}
\label{sec:casestudy3}

\subsection{What was studied}

This case study consists of simulated attacks against an
implementation of secudep. Secudep's main defense against attacks is
the use of encryption (TLS) and digital signatures.

Table~\ref{tab:comparison_table} contains a list of protocols involved
in the operating system installation process.

The first two protocols, DHCP for address resolution and DNS for name
resolution, are insecure and susceptible for example to
man-in-the-middle attacks. Loading the boot menu over HTTPS with a
digital signature check should validate that DHCP and DNS are not
tampered with and that the installation can proceed further.

After the boot menu step is done, secudep loads kernel and initrd over
an unsecured HTTP connection. A man-in-the-middle attack could change
the kernel or initrd files to something else, but digital signature
verification should notice that and prevent running possibly malicious
content.


\subsection{How it was done}

Secudep boot media contains at least two public keys. One is for
digital signature verification, and one or more are for verifying
HTTPS connections. More public keys are loaded over a HTTPS connection
while the boot progresses.

Testing that these verifications work can be done by either omitting
the public key from secudep boot media or serving the wrong public key
from secudep's HTTPS server.

      \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

Table~\ref{tab:attack_and_defence} lists the steps during the boot
process and what verification methods are used to defend against
attacks.

DHCP and DNS man-in-the-middle attacks can be detected when X.509
certificate verification fails, and HTTP man-in-the-middle attacks can
be detected when code signing verification fails.

      \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

Table~\ref{tab:verification_files} lists the files used during each
step in the installation process. Any failure in verification should
halt the installation process.


\subsection{Results found}

      \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

Five different tests were made, with their results displayed in
Table~\ref{tab:mechanical_check_results}. Every simulated attack was
noticed and the installation was halted. Table also gives iPXE's error
code for each tested case.


\subsection{Analysis of results}

Five different tests were made by breaking one verification step at a
time and trying to perform the installation. The result was observed
and materials collected.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \caption{Installation process is halted when digital signature
    verification fails.\label{fig:verify-fail}}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{verify-fail.png}
\end{figure}

Two distinct iPXE error codes were found while conducting the
tests. One example of these error is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:verify-fail}. The installation process could not
verify the digital signature. The process was halted and it could not
proceed further.

The first error code, ``0216eb3c'' is
documented\footnote{http://ipxe.org/err/0216eb3c} on the iPXE web page
as ``Error: No usable certificates''. This matches what was tested. In
the test a wrong certificate was provided, so the error given is
correct.

The second error code ``0227e13c'' is
documented\footnote{http://ipxe.org/err/0227e13c} on the iPXE web page
as ``Error: RSA signature incorrect'' with additional notes stating:

\begin{quote}
This error indicates that an RSA signature was found to be incorrect.

Things to try:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Check that all certificates are correct.
\item If you are verifying a digital signature using the imgverify
  command, check that you are using the correct signature file.
\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}

This matches what was tested. Either a wrong RSA signature was given
in test, or the file was changed so that the RSA signature
verification should fail. This error message is correct.

This case study tested only the most obvious security issues. More
sophisticated attacks might exploit the implementation weaknesses in
iPXE and other software and hardware. Thus this case study is not
proof of perfect security, but shows that at least some cases of
attacks can be detected and reacted on.


\section{Analysis of Case Studies}

Three separate case studies were conducted. Case studies identified
how a current state-of-the-art installation system operated, and ended
in proving that the technologies used in secudep can be used to detect
and prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. Security analysis or security
testing of a state-of-the-art installation system implementation was
not performed.

Comparison between secudep and another installation system showed how
secudep introduces cryptography (TLS and digital signatures) into the
installation process to protect the installation. Simple testing shows
that secudep is capable of preventing attacks using TLS and digital
signatures.
