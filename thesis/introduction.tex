% \section{History}

Loading operating system into computer remotely over network
(``network booting'', ``diskless booting'') has been used for
decades. Network booting can be used to bootstrap operating system
installation (``network installation'') or it could be used for
diskless nodes to load the operating system and run it using disk
provided by server.

Usually network installation systems are built to serve single
organization (e.g. university department or single business) to
achieve repeatable and homogeneous installations. For example school's
computer class wants to have identical installations on all machines
and reinstalling the machines should be as simple and as fast as
possible.

Many Linux distributions offer ``netinstall'' where small image is
used to boot the computer into state where rest of the installation
software and packages can be downloaded directly from Internet.

\section{Protocols}

Multiple procotols have been developed and used in combination to
allow booting using IP network. Early published standards include RARP
(``A Reverse Address Resolution Protocol'', RFC903, published
1984\cite{RFC903}) and BOOTP (``Bootstrap Protocol'', RFC951, published
1985\cite{RFC951}) could be used to allow ``a diskless client machine
to discover its own IP address''\cite{RFC951}, TFTP (``Trivial File
Transfer Protocol'', RFC783, published 1981\cite{RFC783}) ``may be
used to move files between machines on different networks implementing
UDP.''\cite{RFC783}.

Later developments include RARP and BOOTP to be superseded by DHCP
(``Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol'', RFC1531, published
1993\cite{RFC1531}) and TFTP superseded by NFS (``Network File
System'', RFC1094, published 1989\cite{RFC1094}) which ``provides
transparent remote access to shared files across
networks.''\cite{RFC1094} PXE (``Preboot Execution
Environment''\cite{PXEspec}) is specification from Intel Corporation
to standardize preboot environment for network booting.


\section{Current state}

Alpine Linux's PXE Boot HOWTO\cite{alpine-pxe-boot-howto} summarises
the current situation:

\begin{quote}
Alpine can be PXE booted starting with Alpine 2.6-rc2. In order to
accomplish this you must complete the following steps:

\begin{itemize}
\item Set up a DHCP server and configure it to support PXE boot.
\item Set up a TFTP server to serve the PXE bootloader.
\item Set up an HTTP server to serve the rest of the boot files.
\item Set up an NFS server from which Alpine can load kernel modules.
\item Configure mkinitfs to generate a PXE-bootable initrd.
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

As we can see, the whole process still relies on old protocols DHCP,
TFTP, HTTP and NFS developed around 1980--1990. However, these
protocols are not secure and should not be used over Internet.

TFTP, NFS and HTTP protocols can be replaced with HTTPS (HTTP over
TLS) where TLS protocol provides communications security using
cryptocraphy and authentication of one or both communicating parties.


\section{Threats}

Threats can be indentified in all components from hardware to
operating system vulnerabilities. Table~\ref{tab:threats_table} lists
some common known attacks which could be targeted towards network
booting or network installation infrastructure.

    \caption{Roles and threats of various components used in operating
      system installation over network}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

Hardware (e.g.  physical server or laptop) and peripherals
(e.g. displays, keyboards, mice, removable medias) can have backdoored
firmware. The backdoors could have been installed already on factory
or firmware was infected with some malware previously ran on the
machine.

DHCP and DNS protocols could be used to redirect future communications
into malicious services. DHCP is commonly used to assign IP address to
client and give various information (TFTP server's IP address, DNS
servers' IP addresses). Malicious DHCP can take over future TFTP and
DNS communications. DNS has many uses, but commonly it's used to
translate host name into IP address and malicious DNS server could
redirect future communications into malicious services.

TFTP, NFS and HTTP protocols could be used to deliver malicious files
which when executed in target system could compromise the operating
system installation and even firmwares of the hardware the operation
was performed.

There's no alternative to DHCP and DNS, but the threats can be
detected by other components (TLS's server authentication, code
signing) and installation process halted if something malicious is
happening.

\section{Mitigation}

Threats can be mitigated by using trusted media, secure communication
channel and cryptographically signed files.

Boot environment is loaded from trusted media, for example using
prebuilt USB mass media. This media contains software and files to
safely load next steps required to load operating system kernel and
other files safely over network.

Network communication is done using HTTPS with X.509 certificate
pinning. This authenticates the remote end and makes it harder to MITM
attack the connection. If secure channel can't be opened, the
boot process should be halted.

Signed files are used to ensure authenticity of files used for
booting. For example many Linux distribution mirrors only provide
files via HTTP or FTP servers which are susceptible to MITM attack. If
signature check fails the boot process should be halted.
