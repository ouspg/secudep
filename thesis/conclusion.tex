This thesis took a look what network based threats could face
installation infrastructure and then studied how to protect the
initial phases (before OS kernel took the control of excecution) of
installation process using encryption and file signing.

Protecting every step of communications over networks is important and
protecting installation infratructure is no exception. This thesis has
shown that it's possible to take a step further in more secure
installation infrastructure by using two technologies: encryption and
file signatures.

More testing and verification should be performed for iPXE
and it's TLS implementation and file signing capabilities. This was
intentionally left out from this thesis.
